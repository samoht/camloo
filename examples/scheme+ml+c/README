This directory contains several source files written in Scheme, ML and C.
These files are compiled separatly (using Bigloo and cc) and linked together
to produce a unique standalone.

   - ML uses Scheme (the invocation of `nreverse', a physical list reversing).
   - Scheme uses ML (the list built by ML)
   - Scheme uses C (`struct el' and `print_el_list').
   - C uses Scheme (the invocation of `fib').
