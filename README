This directory contains a port of the Caml-Light toolchain to bigloo.

* src/runtime is compiled to the camloo-runtime library; the
  Caml-Light's runtime and its standard library have been translated
  into bigloo code -- there are still some C bits so camloo uses only
  the C backend of bigloo (at the moment - there are some plans to
  port the remaining bits of C code to bigloo, any help to complete
  this task appreciated)

* src/camloo is compiled into the camloo binary; it contains two parts
	(i) an extension of the caml-light compiler version 0.6 (and its
	translation to bigloo); and (ii) some bigloo code which takes as
	input the lambda-terms representing the compiled ML program which
	has been produced by the caml-light compiler.

* Makefile.camloo is an helpfull Makefile to produce binary from a
	bunch of ml, mli, scm and C files.  Check examples of utilization
	in examples/ or benchmarks/.
