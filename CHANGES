* Makefile clean-ups

0.4.4 [28 June 2010]
* Use the new API's Makefile of bigloo-3.3b-beta
* Generate a single binary named camloo -- option to the ML compiler can be passed using the -mlopt option -- This change also simplifies a little bit Makefile.camloo
* Better support for OSX
* Compilation should now work for 'defensive' GLIBC which are trying to prevent buffer overflow (as does Ubuntu) -- This was a bug in a part of bigloo that only camloo was using
